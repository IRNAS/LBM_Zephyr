include: spi-device.yaml

properties:
  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the radio's NRESET signal.

      This signal is open-drain, active-low as interpreted by the modem.

  busy-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the radio's BUSY signal.

      This signal is high when the radio is ready to accept commands, and
      low when it is processing a command.


  dio1-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the radio's DIO1 signal. This GPIO will be used as
      a generic IRQ line from the chip.

  dio2-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the radio's DIO2 signal. This GPIO will be used as
      a generic IRQ line from the chip.

      Note that this conflicts with dio2-as-rf-switch.

  dio3-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the radio's DIO3 signal. This GPIO will be used as
      a generic IRQ line from the chip.

  reg-mode:
    type: int
    required: true
    enum:
      - 0 # LDO
      - 1 # DCDC
    description: |
      Configuration of the radio's power regulator mode.

      See constants SX128X_REG_MODE_* in dt-bindings/lora_lbm/sx128x.h

  # EvaTODO: left out for now, there is no driver support for setting boosted mode
  #rx-boosted:
  #  type: boolean
  #  description: |
  #    Sets the radio in RX Boosted mode, allowing a ~2dB increased sensitivity,
  #    at the expense of a ~2mA higher current consumption in RX mode.

  tx-power-offset:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      Default board-specific TX Power offset in dB. Defaults to 0.

      Can be reconfigured at runtime via radio_utilities_set_tx_power_offset.
